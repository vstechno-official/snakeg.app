# Snake Game 

This is a simple snake game created using Python and the Pygame library. The game is played on a 720x480 window, and the snake moves at a speed of 15 frames per second. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases every time the snake eats a fruit. The game also includes obstacles that move randomly around the screen.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key that was last pressed. If the snake collides with the edge of the screen or with its own body, the game will end.

## Scoring

The player's score is displayed in the top left corner of the screen. The score increases every time the snake eats a fruit.

## Obstacles

The game includes three obstacles that move randomly around the screen. If the snake collides with an obstacle, the game will end.
